"'Alan Smithee' is a common pseudonym for directors whose film was clearly taken away from her/him and recut heavily against her/his wishes in ways that completely altered directors whose film was clearly taken away from her/him and recut heavily against her/his wishes in ways that completely altered the film.The Directors Guild contract generally does not permit a director to remove her/his name from films. Directors Guild has been striving for decades to establish the director as the ""author"" of a film, and part of getting the credit for the successes is taking the blame for the failures. The only exceptions Directors Guild make are cases in which a film was clearly taken away from a director and recut heavily against a director's wishes in ways that completely altered a film. Directors are required to the appeal to Directors Guild in such cases. If the appeal is successful, Directors's name is replaced by Alan Smithee. So if you notice a film directed by Alan Smithee, it is certain a film directed by Alan Smithee is not what a film directed by Alan Smithee's director intended, and likely that a film directed by Alan Smithee is not any good."

From Journal d'un cure de campagne (1951) (aka ""Diary of a Country Priest"") onwards, Robert Bresson created a unique minimalist style in which all but the barest essentials are omitted from the film (often, crucial details are only given in the soundtrack), with the actors (Robert Bresson calls the actors ""models"") giving deliberately flat, expressionless performances. It's a demanding and difficult, intensely personal style, which means that Robert Bresson's films never achieved great popularity (it was rare for Robert Bresson to make more than one film every five years), but Robert Bresson has a fanatical following among critics, who rate Robert Bresson as one of the greatest artists in the history of the cinema. Robert Bresson retired in the 1980s, after failing to raise the money for a long-planned adaptation of the Book of Genesis."

"The son of an affluent architect, Eisenstein attended the Institute of Civil Engineering in Petrograd as a young man. With the fall of the tsar in 1917, Eisenstein worked as an engineer for the Red Army. In the following years, Eisenstein joined up with the Moscow Proletkult Theater as a set designer and then director. the Moscow Proletkult Theater's director, Vsevolod Meyerhold, became a big influence on Eisenstein, introducing Eisenstein to the concept of biomechanics, or conditioned spontaneity. Eisenstein furthered The Proletkult's director, Vsevolod Meyerhold,'s theory with Eisenstein's own ""montage of attractions""--a sequence of pictures whose total emotion effect is greater than the sum of its parts. Eisenstein later theorized that this style of editing worked in a similar fashion to Marx's dialectic. Though Eisenstein wanted to make films for the common man, Eisenstein's intense use of symbolism and metaphor in what Eisenstein called ""intellectual montage"" sometimes lost Eisenstein's audience. Though Eisenstein made only seven films in Eisenstein's career, Eisenstein and Eisenstein's theoretical writings demonstrated how film could move beyond film's nineteenth-century predecessor--Victorian theatre-- to create abstract concepts with concrete images."

Lars von Trier's subsequent features Epidemic (1987) and Europa (1991) have been equally ambitious both thematically and visually, though Lars von Trier's international fame is most likely to be based on Il regno (1994), a TV soap opera blending hospital drama, ghost story and I segreti di Twin Peaks (1990)-style surrealism that was so successful in Denmark that it was released internationally as a 280-minute theatrical feature."
